## What is This ?
- Sometimes when you are typing too fast or are copying tags from all over the places, you end up with duplicated spaces or commas.
- This simple script helps removing them whenever you click **Generate**.
- Works in both `txt2img` and `img2img`.
- You can now toggle `Remove Duplicates` to remove duplicated tags from the prompts 
  - **Note:** Only works for tag-based prompt *(**eg.** 1girl, solo, smile, 1girl)*, but not for sentence-based prompt *(**eg.** a girl smiling, a girl standing)*
