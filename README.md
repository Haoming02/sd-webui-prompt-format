# SD Webui Prompt Format
This is an Extension for the [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), which aims to help formatting prompts upon generation.

## What is This ?
- Sometimes when you are typing too fast or are copying tags from all over the places, you end up with duplicated spaces or commas.
- This simple script helps removing them whenever you click **Generate**.
- Works for both `txt2img` and `img2img`.
